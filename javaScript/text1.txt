1. What is hoisting?

Ans:  Hoisting is a concept whch enables us to extract values from variables and functions even before 
initialising/assigning values without getting any error and this is happening due to first phase(emory execution phase) of execution context.

Hoisting is the JavaScript Default behaviour of moving all declarations to the top of current scope.
